# Automotive SIG Charter
The Automotive SIG provides a global forum for technical and strategic input into activities enabling or accelerating adoption of RISC-V related technology in the Automotive industry.

## Definitions

**ADAS** is Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. While aimed at assisting a human driver, ADAS systems use many of the technologies required for autonomous vehicles, so investment in these technologies represent a good step towards autonomy.

**V2X** is Vehicle to X communications. X may be used directly to refer to all vehicle communications, or replaced by a variety of letters to denote Vehicle, Infrastructure, Network, Pedestrian, Device or Grid (and others!)

**ASIL** is Automotive Safety Integrity Level, as defined in ISO 26262. 4 levels are specified, ranging from ‘ASIL-A’ applicable to the systems with the lowest degree of hazard, to ‘ASIL-D’ for systems with the highest.

**SOTIF** is Saftey Of The Intended Functionality, covering insufficiencies of the specification or performance of vehicle automation systems under operational conditions, rather than functional faults (defined in ISO 21448:2022)

## Background

The global automotive industry is in the midst of its greatest disruption for decades, driven by the switch away from fossil fuels and the progression towards autonomous vehicles - coupled with increasing consumer demand for advanced technologies and the growing capability of onboard processing and communications infrastructure. This disruption provides a rare opportunity for new compute architectures to achieve rapid adoption, but it is already well underway and gathering pace.

## Scope

The scope of the Automotive SIG will include:

- Creating and maintaining a “gap analysis” identifying aspects currently missing in the RISC-V ecosystem to effectively address the Automotive market. 
- Prioritisation of activities to address identified gaps.
- Proposing or interfacing with industry initiatives to enable and promote the adoption of RISC-V in Automotive applications.
- Application of AI to automotive applications, and ensuring SOTIF as defined in ISO 21448
- Development (through task groups) of technologies to advance the safety, security, functionality and performance of automotive systems.
- Activities to develop the ecosystem support from OS, Software and tools organisations.

It will aim to improve the ease of adoption of RISC-V based technology in:

- Safety critical systems from ASIL-A to ASIL-D
- ADAS and autonomous vehicles, covering all SAE J3016 levels 0 - 5
- Drivetrain management
- Body control
- V2x communications

It is not currently envisioned that the Automotive SIG or the task groups it oversees will propose or request changes to the RISC-V ISA.

To achieve its goals, the Automotive SIG will interact with the following groups:
- Functional Safety SIG
- Trusted Computing SIG
- SOC Infrastructure HC
- Other groups as applicable
 
## Deliverables

The Automotive SIG will not deliver any specifications, standards or recommendations. It will develop overall strategy and establish priorities, then create task groups to develop any identified outputs.
